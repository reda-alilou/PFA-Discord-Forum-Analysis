80.0,Need Assistance for my data selector for my Nutrition Tracker.,"Hello, I'm having issues with the date selector in my project. Currently, I created a date selector that goes to the previous and the next date. It goes from date to date like I wanted, but it's not exactly where I want to be. The issue I am having is that the food log does not align with the date. For example, the log should work how your notebook paper works in a notebook, One page is filled with writing, and another page, has different writing. That's how I want my log to look. It's going date form the date, but the tracker itself is not changing and I have no idea how to fix that. This is an example of how I want the trackers to work:https://imgur.com/a/63iFCsSIn this example, it shows two different trackers for two different days. How can I do this for my code? If anyone can help me, that would be great. Here is my GitHub link for this project. https://github.com/Aaliyah1225/Thesis_Statement",Bug Help

468.0,nodejs issues in session retrieval for authentication.,"Here is the gist link - https://gist.github.com/saradhapreetha/0d833d093993a12cc8d5f2918869fff2This is a mern implementation.How I have implemented is the login component is rendered, users submit email and password, an axios call is made to backend login , which verifies user and stores session.I have initiated session middleware and set cors .once login verification and session is set, I send response to frontend , which takes the redirect url and navigates the user to home page. (question : is the session lost here)in home component another axios request to /findMatches is made with {withCrednetials:true} property.This is a protected route , so I call IsAuthenticated middleware function.Issue: in the handle login function, right after setting the user in session, if I print session, i get below as response, Session { cookie: { path: '/', _expires: null, originalMaxAge: null, httpOnly: true, secure: false }, user: { _id: new ObjectId('660bd66780ef1262e5ac53c9'), username: 'localuser', email: 'local@sarg.com', password: 'sarg@123', profileVector: [ 0, 0, 0 ], createdAt: 2024-04-02T09:56:56.003Z, __v: 0 }}but when /findmatches is called, the req.session value in isAuthenticated is as below,Session { cookie: { path: '/', _expires: null, originalMaxAge: null, httpOnly: true }}there is no user object, whyMongoDB is storing the user, please refer to the screenshot.How to access session user, what is wrong here. Please help , my project is stuck because of this authentication issue",Bug Help

To stop the text in the main body from appearing under the nav bar, I positioned these things in a grid, which seems to work.I wanted the top of the nav bar to always stay at the top of the screen and I wanted the nav bar and contents to change size relative to the page/viewport size, so I put the contents of the nav bar in a div, made it sticky and made the height 90vh. I added media queries to change the font sizes and that all seemed to work. Now the issue is that if I make the browser window too small, the nav bar is clipped. I'd like to give the nav bar a scroll bar, but if I add ""overflow-y: scroll;"" to the nav bar, it stops stretching the full page, and if I add it to the div, a scroll bar appears but doesn't work.

149.0,Perspective and image rotation problem on an HTML/JS canvas,"Hi all, I have a project in html, css and javascript where I need to superimpose a logo that the user imports on a background image (a carpet) by simulating a realistic perspective.

The problem: the uploaded image appears tilted or rotated incorrectly, and the CSS overlay effect is not visible, as if the perspective or transformation wasn't applied correctly.

So far, I have 5 things a user can log and they are appointments, auras, medications, mood and seizures. I've set the pages up so that they send the data back to the database. Right now I am trying to create a page which allows the logged in user to select a date and all the information that they have previously inputted from the date they have selected. I am using the bootstrap datepicker for the calendar and have got that all setup and working. I'm trying to display the information in a table but as of right now, whenever the user clicks on a date, it does not display any information. There is no errors in the console, the only thing I can see is the array which appears to be empty. I've included a screenshot of that in fig 1.Exact steps:Go to diary page and select dateExpected behaviour:The user is to select a date and then it displays all the information they have inputted for a selected date in a table.Actual behaviour:The user selects a date but it does not display anything in the table (see fig 2).I'm currently hosting this locally so cannot provide a link to a working prototype but I have a link to a gist.github page which is below:https://gist.github.com/Harry-Clarke-0/772bfc3ec07a89c78c93b6715620e6b1(also the database connection is in config.php)any advice / snippets of code to use is greatly appreciated (modifi)",Bug Help

289.0,HELP me I am lost. (Career Advice),"Hey everyone,I'm 24 years old and recently graduated with a bachelor's degree in IT from a public university in Pakistan. Unfortunately, the education system here didn't provide much practical learning. Professors rarely attended lectures, and most of the time, we were given PDFs of questions to memorize for exams. I didn't take my studies seriously either and ended up copying my final year project from GitHub. After graduating, I felt like I wasted four precious years of my life and was quite depressed.Determined to turn things around, I started my web development journey. After wasting a few months binge-watching YouTube videos, I discovered FreeCodeCamp, which has been incredibly helpful. I've learned a lot by doing projects and am about to finish the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course.Now, I have some questions and would love your advice:When should I start applying for jobs during this learning journey?,I'm considering doing a master's in computer science since my parents can support me financially. Will this degree help me?,After finishing the JS Algorithms and Data Structures course, should I move on to Full Stack Open, The Odin Project, or other FreeCodeCamp courses?,I want to do CS50 and CS50W. When should I fit these into my learning plan?,Do you have any other suggestions for someone in my position?,One thing I'd like to ask is about a suggestion from my friend, who is working as a freelancer and making a good amount of money through Webflow. He advised me to prioritize learning Webflow to start earning money quickly, instead of following long roadmaps like FreeCodeCamp, Full Stack Open, and The Odin Project. Seeing my friend making a lot of money with Webflow sometimes makes me feel that I might be going in the wrong direction. Is my plan okay? Do you have any advice about my plan?Thanks again for your help!",Career Advice

187.0,Where to go from here?,"Hello programmers, I am looking for general advice on which direction I should go in, in terms of learning a programming language. I have very little knowledge of a few languages currently, I started to learn Python, with YouTuber videos and then some fCC information. I eventually stuck with fCC for learning web development but I am getting stuck with trying to understand syntax and structure of these tutorials and not having a video/instruction on where these features and algorithms came about. I lost interest after completing HTML/CSS and some JS, so I switched to SwiftUI thinking I wanted to create iOS apps. But I believe I am falling in the same trap, so much information about these language models and me not knowing where or how to structure my own project let alone understand enough about the YT videos I am trying to follow along and re-typing myself. My question is, does anyone with programming experience have any advice as to where my focus should be heading? I can answer any questions you may have to help pinpoint. I am not in any position to make a career change at this point and no rush to learn in 6 weeks and land a job, I am simply looking to learn because I want to learn it and have fun with it and see where it could take me.
