1,5,Changing careers,"Hello! My name is Simon I'm a web developer but I've been working as an email developer for 3 years (turning 4 this years)I had to accept the email developer full time role job because we were in 2021 and I'm from venezuela so it's either take that job or die. At the beginning of my job I saw people come and go as programmers because they either get fired (they couldn't keep up with the client) or they moved to a different kind of IT field.This week my company told us we should save money due to a possible chain effect from our US clients and to save money, that made me think a lot about the possibility to move from email developing to something more juicy and that pays better.Before I became an email developer in 2021 I was doing web developing as freelancer, among any other web coding feature like wordpress, etc. But it never paid that well.So, Simon why did you stay with the company where you're working now as an email developer? To be frank, they pay really well, I highlighted among my coworkers, I was always early and always there (don't take me wrong I never worked past 8 or 9 hours, only when it's needed and that's been only a few times not that many)... So keep in mind, the salary.I used to work with laravel and wordpress (back in 2020) but I feel so out of game now since I haven't developed a website bymyself from scratch in a long time.What can I do or can I learn to boost my career?",Simon,2025-05-25 16:22:44+00:00

I get how, leaving an open mailto: can leave a website open to getting attacks through email spam by scammers/spammers but how would a mailto: link open up actual users, to being targeted by spammers as the lesson indicates/describes?",Horrificdps,2025-05-03 18:53:13+00:00

1,254,Where to go from here?,"Hello programmers, I am looking for general advice on which direction I should go in, in terms of learning a programming language. I have very little knowledge of a few languages currently, I started to learn Python, with YouTuber videos and then some fCC information. I eventually stuck with fCC for learning web development but I am getting stuck with trying to understand syntax and structure of these tutorials and not having a video/instruction on where these features and algorithms came about. I lost interest after completing HTML/CSS and some JS, so I switched to SwiftUI thinking I wanted to create iOS apps. But I believe I am falling in the same trap, so much information about these language models and me not knowing where or how to structure my own project let alone understand enough about the YT videos I am trying to follow along and re-typing myself. My question is, does anyone with programming experience have any advice as to where my focus should be heading? I can answer any questions you may have to help pinpoint. I am not in any position to make a career change at this point and no rush to learn in 6 weeks and land a job, I am simply looking to learn because I want to learn it and have fun with it and see where it could take me.

1,376,Sections Hide and Unhide,"Good day,I'm sorry to bother you, but I really don't know how to write the following function. I have my own NodeJS Portfolio ( unrealcotemperor.com ) repository located on github (https://github.com/EmperorKunDis/Emperortfolio) and in the container on VPS digitalocean and +/- everything works as I invented a couple of functions here and there and I always it took a day or two at most and I figured it out.But now I've been trying this function for about half a week and I can't see it.In the HTML code, I have several sections, each with a specific name, and I need the welcome, hero, resume, and contacts sections to disappear after pressing, for example, my projects, leaving only the my projects section, where several projects would be displayed. Then, when the user presses other, all sections except the selected one disappear again, and several subsections appear below it. And I just can't accept this simple function.

1,381,Vertical Navigation Bar,"Hi - I'm working on the technical document for the fCC Responsive Web Design course. I'm coming up against an issue aligning the text within my nav bar.

Currently, the Section names seem stuck to the right of the <ul> and I don't understand why. I've put yellow borders around the ul and the li for debugging purposes. Can anyone help?

1,591,Styling a Nav,"For a reason I can't divine nothing I try applies any styling to my navbar. I've tried targeting the element in different ways (element, class and id), targeting a different part (say li instead of ul) and nothing I do makes it so much as budge. I'm flabbergasted. The previous project was half about the navbar too, and for the life of me I can't figure out what's different. Below is a link to the repo that contains my current draft, in the Product Landing Page folder. https://github.com/MojoBoingo/mojos-project-portfolio/tree/master/Product%20Landing%20PageCurrently I'm trying to use flexbox to lay out the nav as a row instead of a column.

1,601,::before and ::after to create a hamburger icon,"Hey all!This is the code: https://gist.github.com/zenonmesic/ac335a5c48eb1b180e361e2f265ba93eI am following a guide on how to create a hamburger icon. It uses an empty div and then ::before and ::after to add two extra lines that are then moved above and below the div and that is it. I am playing with it to actually understand how it works and I have read the documentation but it is still not clear to me.Note before I start: I changed some colors, added the 1s and changed space-between to space-evenly just to better see and understand things.The div is in button element, which is an in-line element. Here the button is given square dimensions of 48px. The div is a block-level element inside button but it has no content so it has been given fixed dimensions of 40px x 5px. The button is also set to display: flex to help center that div within the button. It is then given position: relative because we will be using position: absolute within the button.Next, contentless ::before and ::after are given the same dimensions as our contentless div. Since the div has no real content, ::before and ::after have the same starting point, which is ""in the middle"" of our centered div. They have fixed width so they stretch outside of the div.Okay, so far, so good.Now, if I add ""1"" as content to my div and also ""11"" to ::before and ::after, since div now has some content, ::before moves a bit to the left, and ::after a bit to the right. Also understandable.Now my questions:What is the parent element of ::before and ::after? The div they are being attached to or the button element?,When we put position: absolute in .menu-icon, .menu-icon::before, .menu-icon::after, they are taken outside of the normal flow and now they are placed relative to their parent, in this case the button for menu-icon. Why is menu-icon div centered? Does flex centering still apply to it, even though it is now in absolute ""mode""?,(modifi)",Zenon,2023-06-10 14:52:03+00:00

1,748,Curious about part of this FCC Exercise (Building a Picasso Painting),"Hi guys. So, I'm pretty new to coding in general, still finding my feet. As I move through the exercises on FCC, one thing I try to watch out for is when I don't understand why a piece of code did what it did. It's correct in the exercise, and I can move on to the next step, but I don't really understand. So I try to figure it out (unless it wastes too much time). After finding this discord I figured I'd see if anyone felt like answering.So in the screenshot you can see my CSS and the preview image. The portion I'm curious about is the white-hat container and it's id selector. As you can see I've moved on to the next step, the code is correct for the exercise. After creating a solid border and editing it, the result is a white triangle near the top of the painting. What I'm puzzling over is what caused it to take the triangular shape. As I look over the code I'm not sure, and I'd like to understand. (modifi)",Brady,2022-12-14 22:21:58+00:00

2,1,CSS Not Showing on HTML Webpage (BlueHost),"I'm working on hosting a webpage for the first time so I can better test and try out different code; my first hurdle is that I don't really understand webhosting at all. For reference, I built an extremely simple HTML Webpage to host at https://kycanlearn.com/ and linked my CSS file into the HTML file using the ""link rel=stylesheet href=""(file name)"" function, and placed it in the same directory folder as the HTML file. As you can see on the webpage, the HTML file is showing how it should, but the CSS is nowhere to be found. I asked the BlueHost chat support and they said they can't help me because it's an issue of third party script causing my CSS to not sync correctly. I am too new at this to understand what this means or how to fix it and Google seems to want me to clear either my cache (which I've done) or BlueHost cache (which I can't figure out how to do). For reference, it all shows up how it should on my VSCode live portal, so I don't think it's a problem with my actual code, though I'll share it (let me know if I need to share more);;<head> <title>Ky Can Learn :: Home</title> <meta charset=""UTF-8""> <meta name=""description"" content=""A learning journey""> <meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0""> <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""/public_html/styles.css""> </head>I'm not at home right now so I can only do so much, but please tell me if you need anything else from me!

2,5,Thoughts On Sass,"I am exploring CSS frameworks and libraries like Boostrap, Sass, and Tailwind in that order.I thought Boostrap would be shallow and simple for a framework about built in classes but Sass just takes it even further to an even weirder place in a mixed wayIt has functions, if-else statements, for loops, while loops, the forEach method, import statements, even an increment operator for a CSS extension.What are your thoughts on Sass and would that make it better or worse based on what I said?

2,9,Changing careers,"Hello! My name is Simon I'm a web developer but I've been working as an email developer for 3 years (turning 4 this years)I had to accept the email developer full time role job because we were in 2021 and I'm from venezuela so it's either take that job or die. At the beginning of my job I saw people come and go as programmers because they either get fired (they couldn't keep up with the client) or they moved to a different kind of IT field.This week my company told us we should save money due to a possible chain effect from our US clients and to save money, that made me think a lot about the possibility to move from email developing to something more juicy and that pays better.Before I became an email developer in 2021 I was doing web developing as freelancer, among any other web coding feature like wordpress, etc. But it never paid that well.So, Simon why did you stay with the company where you're working now as an email developer? To be frank, they pay really well, I highlighted among my coworkers, I was always early and always there (don't take me wrong I never worked past 8 or 9 hours, only when it's needed and that's been only a few times not that many)... So keep in mind, the salary.I used to work with laravel and wordpress (back in 2020) but I feel so out of game now since I haven't developed a website bymyself from scratch in a long time.What can I do or can I learn to boost my career?",Simon,2025-05-25 16:22:44+00:00

2,63,Need Assistance for my data selector for my Nutrition Tracker.,"Hello, I'm having issues with the date selector in my project. Currently, I created a date selector that goes to the previous and the next date. It goes from date to date like I wanted, but it's not exactly where I want to be. The issue I am having is that the food log does not align with the date. For example, the log should work how your notebook paper works in a notebook, One page is filled with writing, and another page, has different writing. That's how I want my log to look. It's going date form the date, but the tracker itself is not changing and I have no idea how to fix that. This is an example of how I want the trackers to work:https://imgur.com/a/63iFCsSIn this example, it shows two different trackers for two different days. How can I do this for my code?

I'd like the user to be able to upload an image that contains the overlay of the carpet with their logo. The problem: the uploaded image appears tilted or rotated incorrectly, and the CSS overlay effect is not visible, as if the perspective or transformation wasn't applied correctly. (This is the component on the right in the screenshot).What I did: I place the image on the carpet using a CSS/JS transformation to give the perspective and overlay effect.Once the logo is placed on the carpet, I use html2canvas to preview (on the right in the screenshot) and export the image.Thanks in advance for your help!Website: https://tapis-website-perso.vercel.app/",unkn0wnd.fbx,2024-10-24 09:40:27+00:00

To stop the text in the main body from appearing under the nav bar, I positioned these things in a grid, which seems to work.I wanted the top of the nav bar to always stay at the top of the screen and I wanted the nav bar and contents to change size relative to the page/viewport size, so I put the contents of the nav bar in a div, made it sticky and made the height 90vh. I added media queries to change the font sizes and that all seemed to work. Now the issue is that if I make the browser window too small, the nav bar is clipped. I'd like to give the nav bar a scroll bar, but if I add ""overflow-y: scroll;"" to the nav bar, it stops stretching the full page, and if I add it to the div, a scroll bar appears but doesn't work.

I have overflow-x set to true on that div and sometimes it works fine but then again, sometimes it doesn't. I don't know if this is a css issue or a js issue.

I have very little knowledge of a few languages currently, I started to learn Python, with YouTuber videos and then some fCC information. I eventually stuck with fCC for learning web development but I am getting stuck with trying to understand syntax and structure of these tutorials and not having a video/instruction on where these features and algorithms came about. I lost interest after completing HTML/CSS and some JS, so I switched to SwiftUI thinking I wanted to create iOS apps. But I believe I am falling in the same trap, so much information about these language models and me not knowing where or how to structure my own project let alone understand enough about the YT videos I am trying to follow along and re-typing myself. My question is, does anyone with programming experience have any advice as to where my focus should be heading? I can answer any questions you may have to help pinpoint. I am not in any position to make a career change at this point and no rush to learn in 6 weeks and land a job, I am simply looking to learn because I want to learn it and have fun with it and see where it could take me.

2,237,Portfolio Help,"Hi everyone,I've been working on my photography portfolio for some time now, but progress has been slow since I sometimes leave it for months and forget where I left off. I'm relatively new to HTML and CSS and have self-taught myself along the way, often relying YouTube videos and recycling code sometimes. A lot of stuff is broken and vie had problems trying to port it to mobile to make it look nice. As of right now most of my dropdowns are broken and my code is messy. A lot of the stuff in the navbar is not usuable right now. My navbar has given me a lot of struggles as well. Ive tried centering the information countless times and can never seem to get it to work. Mobile porting is a complete mess but it has kinda the desired look as i dont want it to look the same as it does on the desktop variant. Could anyone take a look at my portfolio and offer suggestions on how to improve it? Any feedback on design, layout, or code would be greatly appreciated!

2,435,Export Custom CSS Variables (SASS) to JS,"After researching, I've found two methods that I'd like to use (https://www.falldowngoboone.com/blog/share-variables-between-javascript-and-css/) for reading SASS from JS: CSS modules. However, I'm really confused about how they actually function, so could someone please explain anything I've understood wrong?1) .module files seem to be CSS files, seemingly only containing variables/exports; element styling seems to be invalid. In my case, I'm using styling alongside the SASS I'd like to export, so this wouldn't be ideal. Assuming .module CSS files are like a superset of standard .css CSS files, could someone help me understand the ""module rules test loader"" cult summoning magic? Is this ""webpack"" that I see mentioned everywhere an additional module used to help create modules that can be exported to JS? 2) @value seems to be a more compact and concise version of the above, however its exports are limited to variables (no functions, etc.)",WINNER,2023-09-26 18:39:07+00:00

2,442,Responsive SVG,"How do I make my SVG responsive on different screens? I've done a lot of research, but haven't found many detailed answers at all.The best idea I've heard is giving the SVG auto width/height and parenting it to a responsive container, but isn't stuff like XScale/YScale's range only in pixels? Wouldn't this mean that the SVG won't always contain the graphs, as the values could be mapped between 10 and 10000000 pixels? Or are these pixels abstract sizes that are mapped to the SVG, and viewBox is an attribute which can adjust this mapping scaling?This is actually really confusing since the d3 challenges only explained the abstract rough concepts, so I'm having to scroll for hours on stack and google trying to find details which I really can't findAny help at all would be really helpful",WINNER,2023-09-18 16:48:45+00:00

2,504,"Product Landing Page - Clipping, overflow, and user style agent","Ive been having some CSS issues on my product landing page project. The majority of my code is cutoff horizontally when the window resizes; it fits itself as if there wasnt a large amount of white space immediately to the right. The exception is img elements, which arent affected for some reason. Ive tried a lot of debugging, making sure the width is set, that no parent elements are imposing any other styling, until finally I tried using 3.5 to help me debug, was reminded of devtools, and realized the user style agent was applying code snippets like this:img { overflow-clip-margin: content-box; overflow: clip; }Im pretty sure this is the issue, though Im not certain. Im genuinely not sure where to go from here. If theres an obvious answer Ive gotten my wires too crossed to see it. Here is the repo containing the current draft, under the aptly named Product Landing Page folder: https://github.com/MojoBoingo/mojos-project-portfolio/tree/master/Product%20Landing%20PageI should disclaimer this is only what I think to be the issue after all the troubleshooting. I'm honestly not certain. It's not doing great things for my confidence. I also have the code in a GitHub codespace at the moment, though I'm not sure how to link access to those.

It uses an empty div and then ::before and ::after to add two extra lines that are then moved above and below the div and that is it. I am playing with it to actually understand how it works and I have read the documentation but it is still not clear to me.Note before I start: I changed some colors, added the 1s and changed space-between to space-evenly just to better see and understand things.The div is in button element, which is an in-line element. Here the button is given square dimensions of 48px. The div is a block-level element inside button but it has no content so it has been given fixed dimensions of 40px x 5px. The button is also set to display: flex to help center that div within the button. It is then given position: relative because we will be using position: absolute within the button.Next, contentless ::before and ::after are given the same dimensions as our contentless div. Since the div has no real content, ::before and ::after have the same starting point, which is ""in the middle"" of our centered div. They have fixed width so they stretch outside of the div.Okay, so far, so good.Now, if I add ""1"" as content to my div and also ""11"" to ::before and ::after, since div now has some content, ::before moves a bit to the left, and ::after a bit to the right. Also understandable.Now my questions:What is the parent element of ::before and ::after? The div they are being attached to or the button element?,When we put position: absolute in .menu-icon, .menu-icon::before, .menu-icon::after, they are taken outside of the normal flow and now they are placed relative to their parent, in this case the button for menu-icon. Why is menu-icon div centered? Does flex centering still apply to it, even though it is now in absolute ""mode""?,(modifi)",Zenon,2023-06-10 14:52:03+00:00

It's correct in the exercise, and I can move on to the next step, but I don't really understand. So I try to figure it out (unless it wastes too much time). After finding this discord I figured I'd see if anyone felt like answering.So in the screenshot you can see my CSS and the preview image. The portion I'm curious about is the white-hat container and it's id selector. As you can see I've moved on to the next step, the code is correct for the exercise. After creating a solid border and editing it, the result is a white triangle near the top of the painting. What I'm puzzling over is what caused it to take the triangular shape.

My name is Simon I'm a web developer but I've been working as an email developer for 3 years (turning 4 this years)I had to accept the email developer full time role job because we were in 2021 and I'm from venezuela so it's either take that job or die. At the beginning of my job I saw people come and go as programmers because they either get fired (they couldn't keep up with the client) or they moved to a different kind of IT field.This week my company told us we should save money due to a possible chain effect from our US clients and to save money, that made me think a lot about the possibility to move from email developing to something more juicy and that pays better.Before I became an email developer in 2021 I was doing web developing as freelancer, among any other web coding feature like wordpress, etc. But it never paid that well.So, Simon why did you stay with the company where you're working now as an email developer? To be frank, they pay really well, I highlighted among my coworkers, I was always early and always there (don't take me wrong I never worked past 8 or 9 hours, only when it's needed and that's been only a few times not that many)...

I've run into a bit of a snag on the Pokmon Search App project.Right now my JavaScript looks like this:const pokeProxyUrl = ""https://pokeapi-proxy.freecodecamp.rocks/api/pokemon"";const pokeFetch = async () => {  try {    const res = await fetch(pokeProxyUrl);    const data = await res.json();    breakDownData(data);  } catch (err) {    console.error(err);  }}pokeFetch();const breakDownData = (data) => {  const { results } = data;  const pokeIds = results.map((obj) => {const { id } = obj});  console.log(pokeIds);};What I want to do is use breakDownData() to destructure the results array from the PokAPI Proxy data object to get the ids and names of the pokemon, and store them separately in two arrays for later use. I decided to use map() to loop through the results array and use map()'s inner callback function to destructure each object inside the array. Right now I just have pokeIds since I wanted to figure out how to get one array done, and expand to two from there.Expectations were:pokeIds = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5...] // ... being the rest of the Pokmon idsBut instead the console showed this (I temporarily moved the code to a CodePen since console.log in the fCC text editor is quite slow, link is: https://codepen.io/jumpingJellyBeans/pen/MWRmmEP):[undefined,undefined,undefined,undefined...] // ... being the array continuing on in the same fashionIn other words, the array is ""formed"" but instead of the actual id values, it's returning undefined for all of them. :'D I thought it could be a problem with the async function not finishing before breakDownData(), but the same behaviour happened even with the order of the functions reversed. The results array itself, though, logs to the console just fine: it displays an array of objects, each with id, name, and url properties.So, I'm wondering where I'm going wrong in terms of destructuring the results array properly to get the id and name properties?

Now, the string ""This works!"" should appear in the console.An important thing to know about the return keyword is that it does not just define a value to be returned from your function, it also stops the execution of your code inside a function or a block statement.

Unfortunately, the education system here didn't provide much practical learning. Professors rarely attended lectures, and most of the time, we were given PDFs of questions to memorize for exams. I didn't take my studies seriously either and ended up copying my final year project from GitHub. After graduating, I felt like I wasted four precious years of my life and was quite depressed.Determined to turn things around, I started my web development journey. After wasting a few months binge-watching YouTube videos, I discovered FreeCodeCamp, which has been incredibly helpful.

Will this degree help me?,After finishing the JS Algorithms and Data Structures course, should I move on to Full Stack Open, The Odin Project, or other FreeCodeCamp courses?,I want to do CS50 and CS50W.

3,290,Event handling for encapsulated socket.io server,"I am creating a node.js webapp with socket.io. I encapsulated my socket server and namespaces to a single module that I call socketManager.js because I heard that this is generally good practice. This module handles everything sockets for my backend like initialization and exports of series of functions to provide limited access to socket functionality. This works great when I want the server to emit an event in particular. However, I have found that while dealing with events originate in socketManager (client event emissions) I cannot access other files or invoke their functionality. I cannot import custom modules into socketManger as most of them import socketManger - and doing so would result in dependency errors. Is there a way to accomplish this, or am I taking the wrong approach?An example of a case I am struggling with is a check-in process I am trying to implement with sockets. The gist of it is a user checks-in, which emits an event to the server, which the socket server receives. It then needs to pass the user data onto a check-in handling function, the only problem is, it's in a different module. The event handler should look like this:'''socket.on('checkIn', socket=>{ //check in handling logic, including data available in another file});'''I've also attached a screenshot of socketManager.js because this won't let me upload the code.",thekzg,2024-07-17 18:29:36+00:00

3,327,why is onclick suddenly being used in the Todo app (step 41),"In the Todo app (js beta) project, we are suddenly asked mid-project to use the onclick property to trigger code but we've been using addEventListener almost exclusively for the whole project. I had to read the step a few times to try to ascertain if I was missing a nuance which was only available for us with onclick. I did notice at the start of this project that the two buttons edit and delete didn't have unique ids, and maybe they don't have unique ids because they were meant to illustrate onclick method of triggering code but I'm just confused by the timing of the intro to this here. Is there something else I'm missing about this (any feature of using onclick for eg that addEventListener doesn't provide maybe?)Link to the step: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/learn-localstorage-by-building-a-todo-app/step-41Also a little disconcerting was that the code being triggered doesn't exist yet at step 41 (so took me aback a bit because of the wording used: ""To enable editing and deleting for each task, add an onclick attribute to both buttons.""

I have my own NodeJS Portfolio ( unrealcotemperor.com ) repository located on github (https://github.com/EmperorKunDis/Emperortfolio) and in the container on VPS digitalocean and +/- everything works as I invented a couple of functions here and there and I always it took a day or two at most and I figured it out.But now I've been trying this function for about half a week and I can't see it.In the HTML code, I have several sections, each with a specific name, and I need the welcome, hero, resume, and contacts sections to disappear after pressing, for example, my projects, leaving only the my projects section, where several projects would be displayed. Then, when the user presses other, all sections except the selected one disappear again, and several subsections appear below it. And I just can't accept this simple function.

You can check your version with firebase --version and update it with npm install -g firebase-tools.,No syntax errors: Make sure there are no syntax errors in your function code that could prevent the function from being loaded.,but, when I follow up with the code, it agrees that I defined the function and exported it correctly.

Specifically, I'm looking for a way to upload these files directly to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) (preferably using signed url) without using in-memory buffers.I've heard of the Tus protocol, but I'm not sure how to implement it for direct GCS uploads in Next.js using next app router.",NeedHelp!!!!,2023-10-13 08:34:21+00:00
3,726,Converting form submission to object,"Hello I am working on a project that involves taking values from a form submission and converting them to an object (eventually I need to be able to store multiple objects/form submissions in an array). So far I have been able to convert the text fields into key/value pairs in an object, but I also have a checkbox that I want to produce a boolean value (checked=true / unchecked=false). Right now when the button is checked it outputs 'yes' and when it's not checked it doesn't include it in the object at all. What can I add to my code to make the checkbox return a boolean value?https://codepen.io/abigaildawson/pen/Vwqopbr",Abigail,2023-10-18 13:56:02+00:00

However, I'm really confused about how they actually function, so could someone please explain anything I've understood wrong?1) .module files seem to be CSS files, seemingly only containing variables/exports; element styling seems to be invalid. In my case, I'm using styling alongside the SASS I'd like to export, so this wouldn't be ideal. Assuming .module CSS files are like a superset of standard .css CSS files, could someone help me understand the ""module rules test loader"" cult summoning magic? Is this ""webpack"" that I see mentioned everywhere an additional module used to help create modules that can be exported to JS? 2) @value seems to be a more compact and concise version of the above, however its exports are limited to variables (no functions, etc.)",WINNER,2023-09-26 18:39:07+00:00

Wouldn't this mean that the SVG won't always contain the graphs, as the values could be mapped between 10 and 10000000 pixels? Or are these pixels abstract sizes that are mapped to the SVG, and viewBox is an attribute which can adjust this mapping scaling?This is actually really confusing since the d3 challenges only explained the abstract rough concepts, so I'm having to scroll for hours on stack and google trying to find details which I really can't findAny help at all would be really helpful",WINNER,2023-09-18 16:48:45+00:00

The challenge is to take the str parameter being passed and return the string true if the characters 'a' and 'b' are separated by exactly 3 places anywhere in the string at least once.My JS solution is:function StringChallenge(str) {   str = str.toLowerCase();  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {    if ((str[i] === 'a' && str[i+4] === 'b' || str[i] === 'a' && str[i-4] ==='b')) {      return true;    }   }  return false;}My current Python code looks like:def StringChallenge(strParam):  strParam = strParam.lower()  for x in range(len(strParam)-4):    if strParam[x] == 'a' and strParam[x + 4] == 'b':      return ""true""    elif strParam[x] == 'a' and strParam[x - 4] == 'b':      return ""true""  return ""false""I get a string index out of range error sometimes depending the input with the Python version.

However, this output is not accessible to my screen reader. After pressing Ctrl + Enter to run the code, I cannot find or read the result of print() statements  it simply doesnt get announced, nor can I locate it by tabbing or using navigation commands.This is very different from the JavaScript curriculum, where console.log() outputs are easy to find and read with my screen reader.

3,1023,"How can I fix this merge sort visualization in React? Sorting is working, visualization is broken.","Hey everyone! I'm working on a sorting algorithm visualizer, and I've got all of my sorting animations implemented except for merge sort, which is proving to be a challenge. I've been at it for days trying to fix it, but I'm running into a few issues. I'd really appreciate some help.The general framework I'm using is to run sorting functions synchronously on the stateful variable barsToRender. By the end of this step, two things are achieved: the input array becomes sorted, and all animation actions are added in the correct order to a queue. Then, the animateArrayUpdate async function will handle the animation queue by updating the highlighted indices (these are representations of which items are next up to get sorted), staggering the animation with setTimeouts, and physically rearranging the bars to show each step in the sorting procedure.Merge sort itself is working properly to sort its input, but I can't get the visualization to update the bars accordingly. Updating the position of the bars involves changing their left properties. I keep running into duplicate key errors, and removing duplicates doesn't seem to be the correct solution. My swapping/copying inside of setBarsToRender seems to be broken. I learned a lot doing this project but I've been stressed out with this last part.Here is the sandbox: https://codesandbox.io/s/condescending-heisenberg-ydepx1?file=/src/VisualizerControls.js",Absolute,2023-03-04 23:09:45+00:00

I have very little knowledge of a few languages currently, I started to learn Python, with YouTuber videos and then some fCC information. I eventually stuck with fCC for learning web development but I am getting stuck with trying to understand syntax and structure of these tutorials and not having a video/instruction on where these features and algorithms came about. I lost interest after completing HTML/CSS and some JS, so I switched to SwiftUI thinking I wanted to create iOS apps. But I believe I am falling in the same trap, so much information about these language models and me not knowing where or how to structure my own project let alone understand enough about the YT videos I am trying to follow along and re-typing myself. My question is, does anyone with programming experience have any advice as to where my focus should be heading? I can answer any questions you may have to help pinpoint. I am not in any position to make a career change at this point and no rush to learn in 6 weeks and land a job, I am simply looking to learn because I want to learn it and have fun with it and see where it could take me.
