1,1,2,if you console.log your quotes what's in there?,ilenia (they/them),2025-05-26 20:57:25+00:00
1,1,3,NaN,legorat,2025-05-26 21:14:57+00:00
1,1,4,everything from the JSON file shows up in the console log,legorat,2025-05-26 21:15:12+00:00
1,1,5,"now you should also console.log all the things, quotes.image,quotes[0], quotes[0].alt, quotes.name, quotes.descriptionfigure out where it breaks",ilenia (they/them),2025-05-26 21:32:26+00:00
1,1,6,Why are you doing quotes[0].alt? Youll probably have to use map on the quotes array to be able to use alt value of each image object in the list (modifi),daily_codes,2025-05-28 22:25:39+00:00
1,1,7,i just want the value of a single object in the list. I don't want to grab everything in the array,legorat,2025-05-28 23:14:54+00:00
1,1,8,"now you should also console.log all the things, ,",ilenia (they/them),2025-05-29 06:09:22+00:00
1,1,9,not yet but i'm trying that right now,legorat,2025-05-29 14:57:02+00:00
1,1,10,"Looks like it breaks when I add the index- trying quotes[0].image, .name, etc breaks it",legorat,2025-05-29 15:01:52+00:00
1,1,11,Gives the same error as listed above,legorat,2025-05-29 15:02:03+00:00
1,1,12,"Looks like it breaks when I add the index- trying quotes[0].image, .name, etc breaks it",@legorat,2025-05-29 16:11:09+00:00
1,1,13,yes but it returns undefined,legorat,2025-05-30 02:55:57+00:00
1,1,14,so it doesn't. What about quotes[0]? what about typeof(quotes)?,ilenia (they/them),2025-05-30 10:10:20+00:00
1,1,15,"quotes[0] returns undefined, typeof(quotes) returns ""object"" in the console",legorat,2025-05-30 18:12:49+00:00
1,1,16,"quotes[0] returns undefined, typeof(quotes) returns ""object"" in the console",@legorat,2025-05-30 20:46:42+00:00

1,4,2,You did not give a proper type to the variable header so it is now of type Node and a Node does not have a nextElementSibling,Alpox,2025-05-26 16:23:23+00:00

1,4,6,"but also when I start typing, I get a ? infront of nextElementSibling why?",localhost,2025-05-26 16:31:10+00:00

1,5,2,"Hello! My name is Simon I'm a web developer but I've been working as an email developer for 3 years (turning 4 this years) I had to accept the email developer full time role job because we were in 2021 and I'm from venezuela so it's either take that job or die. At the beginning of my job I saw people come and go as programmers because they either get fired (they couldn't keep up with the client) or they moved to a different kind of IT field. This week my company told us we should save money due to a possible chain effect from our US clients and to save money, that made me think a lot about the possibility to move from email developing to something more juicy and that pays better. Before I became an email developer in 2021 I was doing web developing as freelancer, among any other web coding feature like wordpress, etc. But it never paid that well.

That didnt work because when I deleted something off the current date and went back to previous date, it would show up. When Id do it again, it would still show the same data I tried to delete.

1,254,2,"Hello programmers, I am looking for general advice on which direction I should go in, in terms of learning a programming language. I have very little knowledge of a few languages currently, I started to learn Python, with YouTuber videos and then some fCC information. I eventually stuck with fCC for learning web development but I am getting stuck with trying to understand syntax and structure of these tutorials and not having a video/instruction on where these features and algorithms came about. I lost interest after completing HTML/CSS and some JS, so I switched to SwiftUI thinking I wanted to create iOS apps. But I believe I am falling in the same trap, so much information about these language models and me not knowing where or how to structure my own project let alone understand enough about the YT videos I am trying to follow along and re-typing myself. My question is, does anyone with programming experience have any advice as to where my focus should be heading? I can answer any questions you may have to help pinpoint. I am not in any position to make a career change at this point and no rush to learn in 6 weeks and land a job, I am simply looking to learn because I want to learn it and have fun with it and see where it could take me. I am open to listening to experiences and stories and see if it shifts anything.",@Asje2005#55,2024-09-20 15:01:45+00:00

I'm relatively new to HTML and CSS and have self-taught myself along the way, often relying YouTube videos and recycling code sometimes. A lot of stuff is broken and vie had problems trying to port it to mobile to make it look nice. As of right now most of my dropdowns are broken and my code is messy. A lot of the stuff in the navbar is not usuable right now. My navbar has given me a lot of struggles as well. Ive tried centering the information countless times and can never seem to get it to work. Mobile porting is a complete mess but it has kinda the desired look as i dont want it to look the same as it does on the desktop variant.

I think there's a close parallel between programming languages and natural langauges in that for fluency you often have to practice, practice, practice. Until then you will have to look things up frequently. What I would suggest is keeping any searches small e.g. the arguments to some API call or the way you structure some syntax. Avoid asking for out and out answers where you learn little. Projects are great at highlighting things you didn't properly take in the first time around.

I just seemed to forget everything Ive done and didnt know where to start and I gave up. I havnt touched it since then and am kicking myself for that. I know how to do things but putting it together from scratch just blanked me. Im going to try again but I want to know if I should have known atleast a few bits or is looking everything up online just what I have to do and somewhat normal? If it takes just googling absolutely everything to start then I guess thats what I have to do but maybe some advice on how to retain some more of what I do would helpful and any other advice is greatly appreciated, Thanks, Fionn",@fionn,2024-04-19 17:58:54+00:00

Its a prime example of utilizing web development to build cross platform software to access as many platforms, and thus people as possible.",bradtaniguchi,2023-08-21 21:25:37+00:00

That typically means meeting or exceeding the basic technical requirements and soft skills required to perform the job and presenting yourself at least as well as other candidates.

It's pretty frustrated when I don't know anything, first I am not English native, secondly I can read the instruction in English or Traditional Chinese, I just don't understand what that (terms) means in coding. I took an hour to try and almost give up, and FCC just tells me to ""keep trying"". If anybody just like me with zero knowledge of coding terms. I highly recommend (as a beginner) to go cheated, not only google the tags. You could ask the AI, it will give you a further explanation and example of that code. I finished the first course on FCC and review it on W3School. It's ok that you don't understand or don't remember anything. I hope this help. Have a great day.",Scho,2023-07-13 07:37:16+00:00

People who cheat on the early exercises tend to struggle very hard on later exercises and forget the things that were covered early on.This process is not fast. Its okay if it takes time.

1,630,2,"Hey, hope you're doing good. There's a couple of things I think are worth pointing out and going over so you end up with a better looking code and page, such as the way you reference elements on css file, element disposition, etc. We can go over that at a later moment if you would like. But to answer the main issue you pointed out - setting the nav element on top of all other elements. For that, you need to define a z-index for the nav element. By default, all HTML elements have a z-index value of auto, which is equivalent to 0. This means that elements without any explicit z-index value set will be placed in the default stacking order based on their position in the HTML markup. In order change that, you could add to the nav element: 'z-index: 1;'",rmnpch,2023-04-20 20:53:02+00:00

1,636,2,"Maybe you're experiencing issues with the scope and timing of your function calls and variable assignments. First of all, make sure that you are exporting and importing the correct values from your files. For example, if you have a function that updates the slider values, make sure that you are exporting that function and importing it correctly in the file where you want to use it.Ensure that you are updating the slider values correctly in your function. You may need to use event listeners or other methods to detect changes to the slider values and update them accordingly. Additionally, make sure that you are assigning the updated values to the correct variables or objects.Check the timing and order of your function calls and variable assignments. It's possible that you are calling your function or assigning your variables in the wrong order, leading to incorrect or outdated values being used.Consider using a state management library or pattern, such as React's state or Redux, to more easily manage and share the slider values between files and components.Use console.log statements and debugging tools to help identify any issues or errors in your code.",LBJ,2023-04-02 20:09:06+00:00

Try using your dev tools on your browser to look at its size. If you open the dev tools and click on the body element in the elements tab, youll see its probably not the size you think it is.

1,722,8,"I've had a bit of fun working on a solution to that problem. Didn't manage to finish it yet, but I can at least already give 2 hints to solve this issue:1) You're currently just drawing lines based on coordinates. Therefor you have no way of knowing which buttons are crossed between the start and end of a line. This forces you to manually input the linked relationships between each button. A better solution is to use Javascript to generate the buttons within a function so you can create objects like this:{  ""id"": 1,  ""state"": ""inactive"",  ""root"": true,  ""linked"": [2]}You can draw the lines along with it.2) You need to use a recursive iterator function to get your links when a button is deactived. It uses the linked property array to find the buttons that are linked to the one being deactived. Then it checks if that button's state property is set to active or not. If not, it can just skip that button. If it has, the recursive iterator kicks in by looking at the linked property again and repeating the same process until it no longer finds any linked buttons that are active. In the meantime it also checks each button for the root property. If that's set to true and it's state is active, it's guaranteed there's still a valid path available and nothing else needs to be deactived. If it doesn't find one, it deactives all the active state buttons it found through the iterator and you're done (modifi)",icecub,2023-01-01 20:20:40+00:00

So, something like if(window.pageYOffsetTop > myElement.getBoundingClientRect().height) you can make your button visible adding a class or making it not hidden in the case of the scroll is bigger than the height of an element.

This week my company told us we should save money due to a possible chain effect from our US clients and to save money, that made me think a lot about the possibility to move from email developing to something more juicy and that pays better.

2,192,2,"Hello programmers, I am looking for general advice on which direction I should go in, in terms of learning a programming language. I have very little knowledge of a few languages currently, I started to learn Python, with YouTuber videos and then some fCC information. I eventually stuck with fCC for learning web development but I am getting stuck with trying to understand syntax and structure of these tutorials and not having a video/instruction on where these features and algorithms came about. I lost interest after completing HTML/CSS and some JS, so I switched to SwiftUI thinking I wanted to create iOS apps. But I believe I am falling in the same trap, so much information about these language models and me not knowing where or how to structure my own project let alone understand enough about the YT videos I am trying to follow along and re-typing myself. My question is, does anyone with programming experience have any advice as to where my focus should be heading? I can answer any questions you may have to help pinpoint. I am not in any position to make a career change at this point and no rush to learn in 6 weeks and land a job, I am simply looking to learn because I want to learn it and have fun with it and see where it could take me.

Just by examining the image, you should be able to spot the difference.Next, use your browsers developer tools (I used Firefox Developer) to inspect your media queries for 650 and 600. (Im not entirely sure what youre trying to achieve at 600, but that one seems a bit wonky.) With the dev tools open, click on the span element inside the search container HTML. Firefox will provide precise feedback on whats wrong under the layout tab.Now, grab the display and drag the width to less than 650px. Watch what happensshouldnt the search input change in size? There are a couple of ways to fix this, either in your HTML or CSS. This should give you a good idea of how to proceed.Feel free to reach out if you need further assistanceIm more than happy to help!

2,252,2,"The short answer is that you can't use an id from the PHP side to make changes to the resulting page. PHP is a server side language. You can imagine it as dynamically generating an index.html page that is served to the client/browser. Once the browser has displayed the page, PHP no longer has control over it.",SaintPeter,2024-05-13 15:51:50+00:00
2,252,3,"Instead, you need to use Javascript on the client side to make changes to the page. JavaScript makes it easy to select and element via the id, IE:const someElement = document.getElementById(""someId"");You can then add or remove a class, or modify the display or visibility property of the element.Looking at your code, you have this:<button onclick=""showText()"">You could pass the row id:'<button onclick=""showText(' . $row['id'] . ')"">' '<span class=""riddleAnswer"" id=""riddle_""' . $row['id'] . '>'Now when you use showText, you have the id and you can pull the span detail from:function showText(rowId) {  const riddleAnswer = document.getElementById(`riddle_${rowId}`);// Change visibility here(modifi)",SaintPeter,2024-05-13 16:01:27+00:00
2,252,4,One side note:PHP is a TEMPLATING language. Using echo statements all over the place kinda loses the power of PHP. Did you know that all of the loop and branching elements in php have non-curly brace equivilents?<table><tbody><?php foreach($row in $rows): ?>   <tr>     <td><?= $row['thing'] ?></td>     <td><?= $row['otherThing'] ?></td>   </tr><?php endforeach; ?></tbody></table>This allows you to write mostly HTML with PHP inside and you don't have to sweat over opening and closing quotes.,SaintPeter,2024-05-13 16:05:45+00:00

2,514,2,"Hi there! First of all, the best reference I have found for all css issues is CSS tricks. here is a link to a guide they have on flex-box: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/Another great resource is Kevin Powell's YouTube Chanell, here is his video on flex-box: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u044iM9xsWUAs far as I understand the units of space they are referring to relate to the available space between each flex item, which would mean the size of the container minus the size of each individual item multiplied by the number of items.so if your have a container that is 500px wide and has 2 child items that are each 100px wide, space-evenly will have 100px of whitespace on either end and 100px of space between the two items (300px of white space to fill 3 gaps).On the other hand, space-around, I think, looks at the two ends as one gap and then divides the space evenly. So in our example, we have 300px of space that needs to be divided between our two flex items. The ends are treated as one gap and there is one more gap between the two items, so for all intents and purposes, our 300px needs to be divided by two, 150px of space between the two items and 75px (150px / 2) on either end.",Jade Freel,2023-05-30 08:14:58+00:00

There's a couple of things I think are worth pointing out and going over so you end up with a better looking code and page, such as the way you reference elements on css file, element disposition, etc. We can go over that at a later moment if you would like. But to answer the main issue you pointed out - setting the nav element on top of all other elements. For that, you need to define a z-index for the nav element. By default, all HTML elements have a z-index value of auto, which is equivalent to 0. This means that elements without any explicit z-index value set will be placed in the default stacking order based on their position in the HTML markup. In order change that, you could add to the nav element: 'z-index: 1;'",rmnpch,2023-04-20 20:53:02+00:00

First of all, make sure that you are exporting and importing the correct values from your files. For example, if you have a function that updates the slider values, make sure that you are exporting that function and importing it correctly in the file where you want to use it.Ensure that you are updating the slider values correctly in your function. You may need to use event listeners or other methods to detect changes to the slider values and update them accordingly. Additionally, make sure that you are assigning the updated values to the correct variables or objects.Check the timing and order of your function calls and variable assignments. It's possible that you are calling your function or assigning your variables in the wrong order, leading to incorrect or outdated values being used.Consider using a state management library or pattern, such as React's state or Redux, to more easily manage and share the slider values between files and components.Use console.log statements and debugging tools to help identify any issues or errors in your code.",LBJ,2023-04-02 20:09:06+00:00

After you can use Javascript property pageYOffset wich keep control of how much in pixels page have been scrolled. Also you can use  getBoundingClientRect() wich will give you the height and a lot of other measures of your element. So, something like if(window.pageYOffsetTop > myElement.getBoundingClientRect().height) you can make your button visible adding a class or making it not hidden in the case of the scroll is bigger than the height of an element. It's just an example, you can make the button appears based on another measure, pick one that is more suitable for you. Hope it helps.",deusiel,2022-12-29 18:20:31+00:00

The first one is a property used only to set an element to the right or left of its container, but it shouldn't be used as a tool for layout.Flexbox, on the other hand, is a tool specifically designed to layout your site.",Darío Valenzuela,2022-12-08 23:06:35+00:00
2,645,4,I want to add that float is there to define how text flows around an element/image. It was just abused for different things before Flexbox came around.If you want to have an image within a textblock around which the text flows you still use float.,Alpox,2022-12-13 09:38:44+00:00

My name is Simon I'm a web developer but I've been working as an email developer for 3 years (turning 4 this years) I had to accept the email developer full time role job because we were in 2021 and I'm from venezuela so it's either take that job or die. At the beginning of my job I saw people come and go as programmers because they either get fired (they couldn't keep up with the client) or they moved to a different kind of IT field. This week my company told us we should save money due to a possible chain effect from our US clients and to save money, that made me think a lot about the possibility to move from email developing to something more juicy and that pays better. Before I became an email developer in 2021 I was doing web developing as freelancer, among any other web coding feature like wordpress, etc. But it never paid that well.

I eventually stuck with fCC for learning web development but I am getting stuck with trying to understand syntax and structure of these tutorials and not having a video/instruction on where these features and algorithms came about. I lost interest after completing HTML/CSS and some JS, so I switched to SwiftUI thinking I wanted to create iOS apps. But I believe I am falling in the same trap, so much information about these language models and me not knowing where or how to structure my own project let alone understand enough about the YT videos I am trying to follow along and re-typing myself. My question is, does anyone with programming experience have any advice as to where my focus should be heading? I can answer any questions you may have to help pinpoint. I am not in any position to make a career change at this point and no rush to learn in 6 weeks and land a job, I am simply looking to learn because I want to learn it and have fun with it and see where it could take me.

You can pretend it's a little bit like f(let x = 3) if you like but that binding only exists until the function exits and only that specific function call can see that value.

3,289,9,"When should I start applying for jobs during this learning journey?Whenever you feel prepared to do so. My typical recommendation is once you see that you satisfy at least 50% of the requirements and the general experience level needed for a job, you should feel safe applying. The more your skills align with the job, the higher your chances you'll get it.I'm considering doing a master's in computer science since my parents can support me financially. Will this degree help me?No. Degrees are just a piece of paper. The reason I emphasize this is because that's pretty much all you report having gotten from your undergraduate (bachelors) experience. You say you just memorized a bunch of answers to questions and skipped out on learning anything for your senior project. So you may have a piece of paper saying you fulfilled the requirements of a 4-year IT program, but you didn't really and you don't seem to feel you got anything of value from the experience. If you do the same thing for 2-3 more years in a masters program, then you will wind up with the same result.If you are willing and able to put in the work to study and learn and take the other opportunities that come with going to graduate school (including probably spending a lot of time beforehand building up the prerequisite knowledge you were expected to have gained in undergraduate school), then you can certainly gain value from attending grad school. But the degree itself isn't worth anything without that effort.After finishing the JS Algorithms and Data Structures course, should I move on to Full Stack Open, The Odin Project, or other FreeCodeCamp courses?All of those are fine options for continuing your learning journey.I want to do CS50 and CS50W. When should I fit these into my learning plan?You can start them whenever you like. CS50 is designed for people just getting started in computer science. It's somewhat intense and fast-moving. But it's approachable if you put in the work.Do you have any other suggestions for someone in my position?It sounds like you're being honest with yourself about how you let yourself down during your time at university and you regret the decisions you made. And now you're trying to get back on track by learning on your own. And I think that's a great attitude. In order to learn from your mistakes, you have to first be willing to admit (at least to yourself) that you made them. Then the hard work begins.

I'm relatively new to HTML and CSS and have self-taught myself along the way, often relying YouTube videos and recycling code sometimes. A lot of stuff is broken and vie had problems trying to port it to mobile to make it look nice. As of right now most of my dropdowns are broken and my code is messy. A lot of the stuff in the navbar is not usuable right now. My navbar has given me a lot of struggles as well. Ive tried centering the information countless times and can never seem to get it to work. Mobile porting is a complete mess but it has kinda the desired look as i dont want it to look the same as it does on the desktop variant. Could anyone take a look at my portfolio and offer suggestions on how to improve it? Any feedback on design, layout, or code would be greatly appreciated!

Is it clear how things work and what steps are needed to integrate it with my code?,Is it actively maintained? Are there 100s of open issues, PRs, and no recent commits, or are the developers actively supporting it? Is there a history of updates to work with newer versions of Node/Next/etc?

That means that it executes in the browser, after the html page is done rendering.The key thing here is that you can't really mix them. A JavaScript variable cannot be ""seen"" by PHP, because PHP is happening before the variable even exists.If you want to send data from your page to your server-side PHP script, you need to do a POST operation via a form, or using the javascript fetch API to send data asnychrnously (without a page refresh).",SaintPeter,2024-02-26 20:19:53+00:00

3,664,2,"If the context data changes, the component re-renders. In this case, the component remains pure relative to its props and state. The data from the context is an input just like props. If the same context data is provided, the component should render the same output.It is kind of confusing and nuanced but even things like buttons that can change the state (either their own state, the state of a parent component, or even a global state like Redux or Context API). The key here is separation of concerns: the render function remains pure because it only describes the UI based on the current props and state. It's the event handlers that are impure, as they interact with the outside world (state, APIs, etc.).I thought about the same thing when first learning React but after someone explained it to me it makes a lo more sense now.",Ken's Code,2024-01-02 17:13:58+00:00

3,708,9,"I was on my phone before and it's tricky to write a lot on there, so I held off on a more comprehensive answer (and deferred you over to MDN). But to focus in on what's happening here, you should note the difference between this inside function expressions (function () { ... }) and arrow functions (() => { ... }). A function expression creates a this context, while an arrow function does not (it gets its this context from whatever function expression/declaration contains it).Consider the following code:const outerThis = this;someFunction(() => {  outerThis === this; // this will always be true.});someFunction(function () {  outerThis === this; // This may or may not be true. It probably isn't true.});With d3, it's actually relatively common to use function expressions for callbacks because d3 has a habit of binding this on callbacks:When a specified event is dispatched on a selected element, the specified listener will be evaluated for the element ... with this as the current DOM element (event.currentTarget).In short: you might just need to change your code to use a function expression if that's what you're looking for.

3,807,6,"Basically this is a reversing technique that instead of using 1 index variable for iteration, it uses 2 (i and j, typically, but this one is called left and right).The left and right are first positioned at both extremes of the string (the very left first character, and the far right, the last character).The way a 2 pointer reversing algorithm works is that you swap the position of the elements that are pointed to by both indices, and after you do the swapping, you increment the left index and decrement the right index in order to move both closer and closer towards the middle of the string/array.Here's a little example, let's consider a string [""H"", ""e"", ""n"", ""l"", ""o""] and two indices left and right initialized at 0 and 4 (index of the letter ""o"").The first iteration of the while loop will swap the H and o: ""oenlH"", and then the indices will be 1 and 3 respectively.The second iteration will swap the e and the 2nd l: ""olneH"", and the indices are now 2 and 2. At this point the next iteration should not be performed but it doesn't affect the performance if it does anyway.The third iteration will swap the n and n (I know, it doesn't make sense with strings or arrays of odd length, but it does with even lengths) and now it's reversed: ""olneH"".It should be noted that strings in javascript are immutable and thus you can't just swap around their characters, you need to convert it to an array of 1-length strings (each character) in order to pass it to this function. reverseString(""Henlo"".split("""")) and then join the result back with .join("""") (modifi)",KozmicLuis,2023-07-18 17:01:11+00:00

In the provided code, the duration is calculated as const duration = 2000/goal;, where 2000 is the total duration in milliseconds and goal is the target number for the counter. To have different durations for each counter, you can adjust the goal value for each counter accordingly. For example, if you want a counter with a goal of 10 to have a duration of 2 seconds, and a counter with a goal of 20 to have a duration of 4 seconds, you can calculate the duration for each counter as follows:const countup = (el:Element, goal:number) => {  const duration = (2000 * goal) / 10; // adjust 10 to the maximum goal value for all counters  console.log(duration)  let counter = setInterval(() => {    if(el.textContent == null) {console.log(""ERROR"")}     else {      let finalNum:number = parseInt(el.textContent) + 1;      if (parseInt(el.textContent) < goal) {        el.textContent = finalNum.toString()      } else {        clearInterval(counter);        done = true;      }    };  }, duration)}useEffect(() => {  document.querySelectorAll('.numberIncrement').forEach((element:Element, index) => {    const goal = infoArray[index][1]; // adjust to get the goal value for each counter    countup(element, goal);  })}, [])In this example, the duration is calculated as (2000 * goal) / 10, where goal is the target number for the counter and 10 is the maximum goal value for all counters. This ensures that the duration is proportional to the goal value for each counter.",omar,2023-06-12 12:48:19+00:00

3,948,3,Lets just say the operations are actually executed in the order you defined them then b would be more performant but it leads to a different result than a. An SQL database would always be doing a because what you usually want is keep a sorting order and then take a specific slice out of the result. Thats what you expect from a data table.If b would be used then you would always only take the specific slice from the default sorting order and then sort only elements in that slice.Luckily databases (surely SQL databases) always do it the right way round (a) no matter what you write.,Alpox,2023-04-10 07:53:27+00:00

3,971,2,"Maybe you're experiencing issues with the scope and timing of your function calls and variable assignments. First of all, make sure that you are exporting and importing the correct values from your files. For example, if you have a function that updates the slider values, make sure that you are exporting that function and importing it correctly in the file where you want to use it.Ensure that you are updating the slider values correctly in your function. You may need to use event listeners or other methods to detect changes to the slider values and update them accordingly. Additionally, make sure that you are assigning the updated values to the correct variables or objects.Check the timing and order of your function calls and variable assignments. It's possible that you are calling your function or assigning your variables in the wrong order, leading to incorrect or outdated values being used.Consider using a state management library or pattern, such as React's state or Redux, to more easily manage and share the slider values between files and components.Use console.log statements and debugging tools to help identify any issues or errors in your code.",LBJ,2023-04-02 20:09:06+00:00

3,1023,2,"Hey everyone! I'm working on a sorting algorithm visualizer, and I've got all of my sorting animations implemented except for merge sort, which is proving to be a challenge. I've been at it for days trying to fix it, but I'm running into a few issues. I'd really appreciate some help. The general framework I'm using is to run sorting functions synchronously on the stateful variable barsToRender. By the end of this step, two things are achieved: the input array becomes sorted, and all animation actions are added in the correct order to a queue. Then, the animateArrayUpdate async function will handle the animation queue by updating the highlighted indices (these are representations of which items are next up to get sorted), staggering the animation with setTimeouts, and physically rearranging the bars to show each step in the sorting procedure. Merge sort itself is working properly to sort its input, but I can't get the visualization to update the bars accordingly. Updating the position of the bars involves changing their left properties. I keep running into duplicate key errors, and removing duplicates doesn't seem to be the correct solution. My swapping/copying inside of setBarsToRender seems to be broken.

4,9,2,"As a blind learner using a screen reader, Ive been progressing through the Scientific Computing with Python course on freeCodeCamp. While the content and explanations are great, Ive run into a major accessibility issue when trying to view the output of Python programs. In the Python curriculum, the platform runs the code in a virtual environment and shows the output in a ""console"" area below the code editor. However, this output is not accessible to my screen reader. After pressing Ctrl + Enter to run the code, I cannot find or read the result of print() statements  it simply doesnt get announced, nor can I locate it by tabbing or using navigation commands. This is very different from the JavaScript curriculum, where console.log() outputs are easy to find and read with my screen reader. The JS console is properly exposed and behaves more like a standard terminal or live region.",@bassem,2025-04-14 12:55:26+00:00

The label of this panel is ""Console"".,On Python challenges, we use the console (labeled ""Console"") for the test results, and the terminal (labeled ""Terminal"") for the print() outputs and syntax errors.,With the fix, you will be able to hear the terminal content just like any live region content. But I thought I should share that in case you want to locate the print() results or the syntax errors.---Separately, feel free to drop a message in accessibility or create an issue on our issue tracker (https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/new/choose) if you have any feedback or bug reports next time (Posts in the help channels can be buried quickly so we might miss these.)",huyenltnguyen,2025-05-05 07:17:50+00:00

4,19,2,"Learning the language is normally quite boring. Projects for the sake of projects can also be quite dull. For many much of the value of being in (taught/paid) education is to keep them actively learning when they'd otherwise move onto something else. There's certainly value in the taught/guided stuff especially when it's free but it seems more like your motivation/purpose is slipping. Having a vague idea of what you want and a vague idea of how to get there is not particularly motivating and I fear that's where you are currently sat.One option is looking at courses to learn by topic and choosing the topic(s) you actually care about. Perhaps then the learning will seem more relevant to you. Another alternative might be finding a project you like and just going for it. Yes you will get stuck but then you find out precisely what you need to get through that block. It's slow going but it can be much more engaging/rewarding than the textbook style learning. Like, ""yes, I've not seen the Sun for two days but I finally got one of my major project goals to work"".  So less of the, ""I can't do project X"" and just have a go at it. Worst case scenario is often just realising what bits you're missing but at least you know. So stuff the code, it's dull stuff. Go and create somehting, get those creative juices flowing. Get those peaks and troughs of emotion as you struggle through mucky sections and bring back the sense of achievement you might be lacking.My two cents but I wish you luck with whatever you do (modifi)",tgrtim,2025-03-12 19:11:31+00:00

I have very little knowledge of a few languages currently, I started to learn Python, with YouTuber videos and then some fCC information. I eventually stuck with fCC for learning web development but I am getting stuck with trying to understand syntax and structure of these tutorials and not having a video/instruction on where these features and algorithms came about. I lost interest after completing HTML/CSS and some JS, so I switched to SwiftUI thinking I wanted to create iOS apps. But I believe I am falling in the same trap, so much information about these language models and me not knowing where or how to structure my own project let alone understand enough about the YT videos I am trying to follow along and re-typing myself. My question is, does anyone with programming experience have any advice as to where my focus should be heading? I can answer any questions you may have to help pinpoint. I am not in any position to make a career change at this point and no rush to learn in 6 weeks and land a job, I am simply looking to learn because I want to learn it and have fun with it and see where it could take me.

The problem I'm facing is when I upload 2 PDFs with completely unrelated information (for eg . One containing information about a corporation , the other containg detailed weather report) It is only picking one of them as its primary context and forgetting about the other . I have to specifically give hints to the AI for it to remember about the other one. Any suggestions , which will help me to make the RAG system handle any type of PDFs (both related and unrelated) ?

This way, you can use WiFiphisher while maintaining SSH access.Instead of enabling monitor mode on the Raspberry Pi's built-in wireless adapter, you can use the WiFiphisher's external USB wireless adapter. This allows you to keep an SSH connection active on the built-in wireless adapter while performing Wi-Fi phishing on the external adapter.Before running WiFiphisher, configure the Raspberry Pi to send logs to a remote server or cloud service. This way, even if you lose your SSH connection, you can still access the logs remotely and view any captured passwords or data.Consider executing a dedicated virtual machine (VM) for WiFiphisher on a Raspberry Pi. This allows you to maintain an SSH connection to the host operating system while executing WiFiphisher in an isolated virtual machine environment.Set up a controlled test environment that can access multiple devices and simulate network conditions. This way you can test WiFiphisher's functionality without relying solely on SSH access.Remember to use these technologies responsibly and make sure you have the necessary permissions and consent before attempting any wireless network testing or penetration activities.",semmyenator,2024-08-28 12:07:25+00:00

4,243,17,"Ah. I took you a bit literally when you said it was almost ""Hello World!"", sorry. What you mean is that you can run your more complex program with several imports outside the virtual environment (if so where are these modules imported from?) but when the environment is activated (and different modules are loaded?) it slows down again? It's not doing something chunky like activating the virtual environment only when you try to execute is it? That can take a little more time than you might expect.Python's virtual environments are generally just fiddling with environment variables to preferentially choose different programs. Any notable slowdown would likely be down the programs being used not being as efficient for some reason (e.g. older versions, compatibility problems, modules linked to less optimised libraries etc. etc.). The virtual environment itself is normally quite a simple thing.I'd still have a look at the output of python -X importtime ... both inside and outside the environment to make sure it's actually the modules slowing you down (is it the import that's a problem or is it execution, or perhaps both).I'd also have a look at the outputs of-python -m siteboth in and outside your virtual environment to see where all these modules are coming from (is it looking in the right places and not e.g. mixing up python 3.11 with 3.10 modules or accidentally picking up condas site-packages or vice versa which could easily mess with efficiency due to compatibility mixups).

4,290,2,I assume you mean IndexError: [type] index out of range? You know the length of your input is len(nums) and it's a zero indexed language so the maximum index is len(nums) - 1. It'd be fair to conclude that must've been exceeded to get that particular exception so why has it happened? Can you spot anything?If it's not easy to spot then it might be worth trying to follow the execution using a couple of test inputs (ideally small ones). If you can't do that mentally or with a pen and paper then get some print statements involved so you know what value is causing the error and when it occurs. There's bigger and badder debugging out of there if you need it but I'd start with the above for now. (modifi),tgrtim,2023-09-16 10:53:59+00:00

4,299,3,Looks like there's enough going on there that it'll be hard to guess at an issue. Best guess if you're following a tutorial very closely is to look carefully at your indentation etc. to make sure the same things run at the same time in your code. It's normally the hardest thing to spot when just following along.If you can't find it yourself you could share the relevant code and someone might be able to help you but see e.g. https://discord.com/channels/692816967895220344/1033845883822948502 for details on how to share it effectively.,tgrtim,2023-08-28 14:52:53+00:00

4,487,22,"Not necessarily. If youre running a server like Flask you need to tell it how to handle each URI (path).Again, Im not familiar with Flask but most such frameworks have a way to map a directory as static files so that the files in that directory are returned when that URI is requested.For example, lets say you have a css and JS files in your assets directory under your project and that directory contains a css directory with styles.css. Maybe you map /static to assets so that when you request /static/css/styles.css itll return your CSS.Remember that some of your URIs are already handled by existing handlers and you dont want them to clash. Right now you only have a / mapping. But later you might have more mappings.Also, be careful what you share via the static mapping. The directory you map should only be files that you wish to be public. You wouldnt want someone to be able to navigate to /static/app.py and see your source code (maybe itll have api keys or passwords or other sensitive info you dont want to be public!)",plamoni,2022-12-28 20:47:43+00:00

4,514,18,"Okay, so Discord bots can connect to Discord over the gateway (which is basically glorified websockets, AFAIK). The gateway transmits every event that happens on Discord, and your desktop app listens for those events so it can update what you see.The problem is that there are a lot of events. So Discord expects bots to specify which events they want to listen to so they aren't overloaded. You do this by declaring your Gateway Intents in your identify payload. Your bot will only receive events that it has declared an intent to listen to.Some of these gateway intents include information that can or has been used by nefarious actors to aggregate user data or violate privacy. These intents are called ""privileged intents"" because Discord has restricted access to them. For a non-verified bot, you can simply turn these on in the dashboard to gain access (you still have to declare the intent in your code, tho). Once your bot goes through the verification process (which is required to join more than 100 servers), you have to apply for continued access to these gateway events.",Naomi,2022-10-08 21:20:39+00:00
